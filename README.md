This repository contains data access and computational analysis for the methods developed in our [manuscript in Angewandte Chemie](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201804046).


## Data

All the sequencing data have been deposited in the [ArrayExpress database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) at EMBL-EBI under accession number [E-MTAB-6456](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6456).


## Code

- [ODN 1 experiment](ODN1.md): synthetic oligonucleotide bearing two 5hmUs at defined positions and proximal non-modified T sites. It also contains two 10-mer barcodes to identify unique reads and eliminate potential PCR artefacts.
- [ODN 2 experiment](ODN2.md): synthetic oligonucleotide bearing two 5hmUs at defined positions and proximal non-modified T sites. 5hmU was incorporated at different levels (%).
- [ODN 3 experiment](ODN3.md): synthetic oligonucleotide bearing one 5hmU at a defined position, all neighbouring A, C, G, T base combinations introduced at random and 6-mer barcodes to identify unique reads and eliminate potential PCR artefacts.
- [*Trypanosoma brucei* chromosome 2](Tryp_chr2.md): demonstration of mapping single-base 5hmU sites and chemical-enrichment 5hmU regions in genomic DNA and resulting tables.
